# Pointers and Arrays (R. Karkanis)

Annotated C90 codes I've written as complementary material for two seminars:
[6-11-2018] Intro to Pointer Variables (A. Zacharia & R. Karkanis)
[13-11-2018] Pointers and Arrays (R. Karkanis)

You will need a compiler that adheres to the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (or newer) standard.

All programs were tested using cl.exe
cl.exe is a tool that controls the Microsoft C and C++ compilers and linker.

In case you find any inaccuracies, mistakes, blunders; be it logical or... illogical;
please inform me. I am just another student.

You are allowed to use the material for whatever reason you see fit.
I'd appreciate & encourage you to inform me in case this material helped you in any way.

The material I've used in the preparation of these two seminars are:
[1] Ted Jensen. "A TUTORIAL ON POINTERS AND ARRAYS IN C", Sept. 2003. [Online]. Available: http://home.netcom.com/%7Etjensen/ptr/pointers.htm,[Accessed Oct. 27, 2018].

Enjoy.
